> Codex v1 local-input note: This migrated skill supports local files and pasted text by default. References to Drive, CLM IDs, Slack, Westlaw, iManage, Ironclad, eDiscovery, dockets, or other remote systems require a separately configured Codex connector/MCP server. When a connector is unavailable, ask for a local export, local file path, or pasted excerpts. If `config/local/codex-for-legal/<practice>/CLAUDE.md` is missing, ask the user to run the relevant `cold-start-interview` or `customize` skill and copy from `config/templates/codex-for-legal/<practice>/CLAUDE.md`.


# $regulatory-legal:gaps

1. Read the gap tracker at `config/local/codex-for-legal/regulatory-legal/gap-tracker.yaml`.
2. If `--close`: mark gap closed with resolution note.
3. If `--accept`: record the risk-acceptance rationale and acceptor, status → risk-accepted.
4. Otherwise: report open gaps by age and materiality.

> Detailed tracker schema, status-report format, owner-notification logic (per-send confirmation, no exceptions), reminder cadence, the close/risk-accept modes, and the consequential-action gate live in the **gap-surfacer** reference skill — load it before doing substantive work.
