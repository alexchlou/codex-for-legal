# $employment-legal:investigation-summary

Drafts a stripped-down, audience-appropriate summary from the privileged
investigation memo. HR summaries contain no privilege analysis. Leadership
summaries are high-level. Outside counsel briefings include full context.

## Instructions

1. Load the `internal-investigation` reference skill and run Mode 5 (Audience summary).
2. If no memo exists yet, offer to draft the memo first.
3. HR summaries must not include attorney mental impressions, credibility
   methodology, or legal exposure analysis.

## Examples

```
$employment-legal:investigation-summary [matter name] hr
```

```
$employment-legal:investigation-summary [matter name] leadership
```

```
$employment-legal:investigation-summary [matter name] outside-counsel
```

> Detailed audience-stripping rules and summary templates live in the
> `internal-investigation` reference skill — load it before doing substantive
> work.
