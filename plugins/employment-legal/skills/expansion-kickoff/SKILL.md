References to Drive, CLM IDs, Slack, Westlaw, iManage, Ironclad, eDiscovery, dockets, or other remote systems require a separately configured Codex connector/MCP server. When a connector is unavailable, ask for a local export, local file path, or pasted excerpts.

# $employment-legal:expansion-kickoff

Starts an international expansion project for a new country — gathers intake,
runs EOR vs. entity framing, drafts cross-functional questions, surfaces
country-specific flags, and creates a persistent tracker.

## Instructions

1. Load `config/local/codex-for-legal/employment-legal/CLAUDE.md` → jurisdictional footprint, escalation table.
2. Load the `international-expansion` reference skill and run the full workflow.
3. If a tracker file already exists for this country (`config/local/codex-for-legal/employment-legal/expansion-[slug].yaml`),
   flag it: "An expansion tracker for [country] already exists. Use
   `$employment-legal:expansion-update [country]` to update it, or confirm
   you want to start over."
4. Create `config/local/codex-for-legal/employment-legal/expansion-[slug].yaml` on completion.

## Examples

```
$employment-legal:expansion-kickoff Germany
```

```
$employment-legal:expansion-kickoff
(skill will ask which country)
```

> Detailed EOR vs. entity framework, cross-functional questions, briefing
> templates, and tracker schema live in the `international-expansion`
> reference skill — load it before doing substantive work.
